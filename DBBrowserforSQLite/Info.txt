To extract the SqLite Database which does includ the imported Czech FOI Data,
run DBBrowserforSQLite\CZFOI.exe to extract the SQlite database file CZFOI.db

The Data in SQLite Database CZFOI.db were imported from the Vesely_106_202403141131.csv

Alternative:
You can easily create yourself an empty Database with the DB SQLite Explorer tool - name it for example CZFOI.db. 
Then download  the CSV File below, and import the CSV-Data into a table of the new Database.
For example I named this Tabele "Czech".

Then the Data from this table were processed using SQLite queries.
The results were again exported to CSV Files.
Which can all be done in the query window of the DB SQLite Explorer Tool.
