Python 3.12.5 and Visual Studio Code Editor were used for the phyton script to create the 3D plot.Â 


The CSV files in this folder were created by SQLite queries with the "DB Browser for SQLite" tool.


When installing phyton make sure you add the phyton path to the Windows path variable,
by selecting the option when asked.


You also need to import the phyton matplot and plotly library, via the Windows command line.
Otherwise, the Phyton script will not recognize the modules.

run in commandline:
pip install plotly
pip install Matplotlib
